# Project Board Setup

This file contains instructions for setting up a GitHub Project Board for managing work on the Web3EOG Cross-Chain Security Monitor.

## Creating a Project Board

1. Go to the "Projects" tab in the repository
2. Click "Create a project"
3. Select "Board" as the template
4. Name the project "Web3EOG Development"
5. Click "Create"

## Recommended Board Structure

The project board should have the following columns:

### 1. Backlog
- Features, bugs, and tasks that are not yet scheduled
- Items should have clear descriptions and acceptance criteria

### 2. To Do
- Work items scheduled for the current development cycle
- Should be prioritized from top to bottom

### 3. In Progress
- Items currently being worked on
- Assign yourself to an item when you start working on it

### 4. Review
- Items with completed work awaiting review
- Associated with pull requests

### 5. Done
- Completed items
- Should include links to the merged PRs or resolved issues

## Issue Organization

We recommend organizing issues with the following labels:

- `feature`: New functionality
- `bug`: Something isn't working as expected
- `documentation`: Improvements to documentation
- `enhancement`: Improvements to existing features
- `security`: Security-related issues or improvements
- `high-priority`: Issues that need immediate attention
- `good first issue`: Good for newcomers to the project

## Project Workflow

1. Create issues for all work items
2. Add issues to the Backlog
3. During planning, move priority issues to To Do
4. Assign issues to team members
5. Move issues to In Progress when work begins
6. Create a branch and pull request for each issue
7. Move issues to Review when PRs are ready for review
8. After merging, move issues to Done

## Automation Setup

You can set up automation rules for your project board:

1. Click on the project settings (three dots in the top right corner)
2. Select "Workflows"
3. Add the following automation rules:
   - When issues are assigned, move them to In Progress
   - When pull requests are opened, move the linked issue to Review
   - When pull requests are merged, move the linked issue to Done
   - When issues are closed, move them to Done

This setup will help manage the development process efficiently.
