# Analysis

This directory contains components for advanced pattern analysis and insight generation.

## Overview

The analysis modules use AI and language models to interpret detected patterns and generate human-readable insights about potential vulnerabilities, security risks, and blockchain activities.

## Features

- LLM integration for pattern analysis
- Context-aware vulnerability assessment
- Natural language description generation
- Risk scoring and categorization
- Historical analysis tracking

## Implementation

The analysis system processes detected patterns through a pipeline that:

1. Enhances pattern data with additional context
2. Formats data for LLM processing
3. Generates queries for the LLM service
4. Processes and structures the LLM responses
5. Stores the analysis results for visualization and alerting

The system uses advanced AI models to interpret complex patterns that would be difficult to assess with rule-based systems alone.
