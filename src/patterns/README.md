# Patterns

This directory contains components for pattern definition, detection, and tracking.

## Overview

The pattern modules define and implement the detection mechanisms used to identify suspicious or vulnerable transaction patterns across blockchain networks. This is the core analytical capability of the system.

## Features

- Configurable pattern definitions
- Multi-chain pattern correlation
- Pattern confidence scoring
- Historical pattern tracking
- Custom pattern creation

## Implementation

Patterns are defined using configuration files that specify:

- Pattern name and description
- Method IDs associated with the pattern
- Parameter structures of interest
- Relationship criteria between transactions
- Sensitivity and threshold values

The pattern detection engine applies these pattern definitions to the indexed blockchain data to identify potential security issues or vulnerabilities.
