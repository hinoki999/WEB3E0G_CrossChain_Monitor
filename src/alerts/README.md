# Alerts

This directory contains components for alert generation and notification.

## Overview

The alerts modules identify high-priority security issues and notify users through various channels. They turn detected patterns and analysis results into actionable security alerts.

## Features

- Configurable alert criteria
- Severity classification
- Multiple notification channels (email, webhook, etc.)
- Alert tracking and management
- Alert aggregation for related issues

## Implementation

The alert system monitors pattern detection and analysis results to identify issues requiring attention. When alert criteria are met, it:

1. Creates a structured alert record
2. Assigns a severity level based on the pattern confidence and potential impact
3. Enriches the alert with contextual information
4. Delivers notifications through configured channels
5. Tracks alert status and resolution

The system supports email, webhook, and dashboard notifications, with extensibility for additional channels.
