# System Architecture

This document provides a detailed description of the Web3EOG Cross-Chain Security Monitor architecture.

## Component Overview

The system is composed of the following major components:

### Block Indexers

- One indexer service per blockchain
- Retrieves blocks and transactions using JSON-RPC
- Processes and stores transaction data
- Maintains synchronization with the blockchain
- Handles chain reorganizations

### Data Storage

- MongoDB for structured transaction data
- Time-series collections for efficient temporal queries
- Vector database for pattern storage and matching
- Separate collections for alerts and analysis results

### Pattern Detection Engine

- Advanced pattern matching system
- Configurable detection rules
- Machine learning models for pattern recognition
- Anomaly detection algorithms

### Cross-Chain Analyzer

- Tracks related transactions across blockchains
- Identifies potential bridge vulnerabilities
- Correlates timestamps and transaction patterns
- Detects replay attacks and double-spend attempts

### LLM Integration

- Processes complex transaction patterns
- Canonicalizes data for analysis
- Identifies potential security implications
- Generates human-readable vulnerability descriptions

### Alert System

- Real-time notification of potential vulnerabilities
- Configurable alert thresholds and priorities
- Multiple notification channels (email, webhook, etc.)
- Alert management and tracking

### Web Dashboard

- Visualization of security alerts
- Transaction and pattern exploration
- Historical data analysis
- System configuration and management

## Data Flow

1. **Block Indexing**: 
   - Block indexers retrieve new blocks from blockchain nodes
   - Transactions are extracted and stored in the database
   - Initial filtering removes irrelevant transactions

2. **Pattern Detection**:
   - Stored transactions are processed through the pattern detection engine
   - Known vulnerability patterns are matched
   - Anomalous transactions are flagged

3. **Cross-Chain Analysis**:
   - Transactions from different chains are correlated
   - Potential cross-chain vulnerabilities are identified
   - Replay attacks and bridge exploits are detected

4. **LLM Processing**:
   - Complex patterns are analyzed using LLM models
   - Natural language descriptions are generated
   - Vulnerability classifications are assigned

5. **Alert Generation**:
   - High-confidence vulnerabilities trigger alerts
   - Alerts are categorized by severity and type
   - Notifications are sent through configured channels

6. **Visualization**:
   - Alerts and analysis results are displayed in the dashboard
   - Interactive exploration of detected patterns
   - Detailed vulnerability information is accessible
