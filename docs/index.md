# Web3EOG: Cross-Chain Security Monitor

Welcome to the documentation for Web3EOG, an advanced blockchain security monitoring system that detects vulnerabilities across multiple blockchain networks.

## About Web3EOG

Web3EOG (Eye of God) is designed to identify security vulnerabilities in cross-chain protocols before they can be exploited. By analyzing transaction patterns across multiple blockchains simultaneously, the system can detect issues that would be invisible when looking at each chain in isolation.

### [Architecture](architecture.html)
Learn about the system's components and how they work together.

### [Methodology](methodology.html)
Understand the techniques used for detecting vulnerabilities.

### [Deployment Guide](deployment.html)

### [User Guide](user-guide.html)
How to use the Web3EOG system effectively.
