# Vulnerability Types

This document describes the types of vulnerabilities that the Web3EOG Cross-Chain Security Monitor is designed to detect.

## Cross-Chain Vulnerabilities

### Transaction Replay Attacks

**Description**: A transaction intended for one chain is replayed on another chain, potentially causing unintended fund transfers.

**Detection Method**: The system identifies similar transaction patterns across multiple chains, particularly focusing on bridge interactions and cross-chain message passing.

**Impact**: Replay attacks can lead to double-spending, unauthorized token minting, or unintended asset transfers across chains.

### Bridge Logic Flaws

**Description**: Logical flaws in bridge contracts that allow improper fund transfers or token minting.

**Detection Method**: Monitors bridge contracts for unusual token flow patterns, particularly focusing on mint/burn operations and lock/unlock patterns.

**Impact**: Bridge vulnerabilities can lead to massive losses, as evidenced by several high-profile exploits in the DeFi ecosystem.

## Smart Contract Vulnerabilities

### Reentrancy

**Description**: A vulnerability where a contract function can be re-entered before its first execution is complete.

**Detection Method**: Transaction pattern analysis to detect multiple calls to the same contract with suspicious timing and state changes.

**Impact**: Reentrancy attacks can lead to fund drainage by calling withdrawal functions recursively.

### Access Control Issues

**Description**: Improper implementation of access controls allowing unauthorized operations.

**Detection Method**: Monitoring of administrative function calls and permission changes, particularly in proxy contracts.

**Impact**: Access control vulnerabilities can lead to unauthorized contract upgrades, parameter changes, or fund withdrawals.

### Flash Loan Attacks

**Description**: Manipulating market prices or exploiting vulnerabilities using large uncollateralized loans.

**Detection Method**: Detection of flash loan patterns followed by suspicious activities across multiple contracts.

**Impact**: Flash loan attacks can lead to price manipulation, oracle exploitation, and draining of funds from DeFi protocols.

## Consensus and Network Vulnerabilities

### MEV Sandwich Attacks

**Description**: Front-running and back-running user transactions to extract value.

**Detection Method**: Identifying transaction ordering patterns that suggest front-running or sandwich attacks.

**Impact**: MEV attacks can lead to unfavorable execution prices for users and extract value that would otherwise belong to users.

### Timing Attacks

**Description**: Exploiting time-sensitive operations in smart contracts.

**Detection Method**: Analysis of transaction timing patterns, particularly around oracle updates and price feeds.

**Impact**: Timing attacks can exploit staleness in oracle data or time-dependent smart contract logic.

## Novel Attack Vectors

The system's AI-powered analysis allows it to identify novel attack patterns that haven't been previously classified. This is achieved through:

1. Anomaly detection to identify unusual transaction patterns
2. Similarity matching to find variations of known attacks
3. LLM analysis to understand the potential impact of unusual patterns
4. Cross-chain correlation to identify distributed attack patterns

When a potential novel vulnerability is detected, the system:

1. Generates a detailed description of the observed pattern
2. Assesses the potential security impact
3. Creates an alert with appropriate severity
4. Stores the pattern for future reference and refinement
