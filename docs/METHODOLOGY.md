# Security Monitoring Methodology

This document explains the methodology used by the Web3EOG Cross-Chain Security Monitor to detect vulnerabilities.

## Data Collection

The system collects transaction data from multiple blockchains using JSON-RPC interfaces. This includes:

- Transaction details (hash, from, to, value, etc.)
- Transaction input data (method ID and parameters)
- Receipt information (logs, events, gas used)
- Block context (timestamp, number, etc.)

## Data Processing Pipeline

Raw blockchain data goes through several processing stages:

1. **Indexing**: Transactions are indexed and stored in the database
2. **Enrichment**: Additional context is added from external sources
3. **Vectorization**: Transaction data is converted to mathematical representations
4. **Pattern Matching**: Data is compared against known vulnerability patterns
5. **Anomaly Detection**: Unusual patterns are identified using statistical models
6. **Cross-Chain Correlation**: Related activities across chains are linked
7. **AI Analysis**: LLM models analyze complex patterns for potential vulnerabilities

## Pattern Recognition

The system uses several pattern recognition techniques:

### Signature-Based Detection

Identifies known vulnerability patterns based on:
- Method ID sequences
- Parameter structures
- Address interactions

### Anomaly-Based Detection

Identifies deviations from normal behavior:
- Unusual transaction values
- Irregular timing patterns
- Atypical gas usage

### Behavior-Based Detection

Identifies suspicious behavioral patterns:
- Multiple withdrawals in short timeframes
- Flash loan followed by multiple exchanges
- Cross-chain interactions with timing anomalies

## LLM Analysis

The LLM component of the system:

1. Analyzes the context of flagged transactions
2. Correlates with known exploit techniques
3. Generates natural language descriptions of potential vulnerabilities
4. Recommends mitigation approaches

## Data Processing

Advanced data processing allows the system to:

1. Represent complex transaction patterns as mathematical vectors
2. Compare patterns across different dimensions (time, value, gas, etc.)
3. Identify clusters of related activities
4. Detect subtle relationships that simple rule-based systems would miss
